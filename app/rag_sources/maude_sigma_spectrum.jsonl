THIS WAS GIVEN ON A SMITH'S MEDICAL MEDFUSION 3500 PUMP USING THE PICU DRUG LIBRARY AND A POTASSIUM CONCENTRATION OF 1 MEQ/ML. THE POTASSIUM DOSE OF 0.05MEQ/KG/HR EQUALED 1 MEQ/ML. THE DOSE WAS INCREASED TO 0.1MEQ/KG/HR AFTER 24 HOURS WHEN THE POTASSIUM WAS STILL LESS THAN 3.0. THE DOSE WAS INCREASED TO 0.15 MEQ/KG/HR AFTER SOMETIME OF THE POTASSIUM REMAINING LESS THAN 3.0, BUT THIS EQUALED A RATE OF 6 MLS/HR.

THE USER REPROGRAMMED THE PUMP WITHIN TWO MINUTES FOLLOWING THE ALARM. THE PUMP RAN THE PROGRAMMED NOREPINEPHRINE FOR 7 HOURS AND 25 MINUTES FOLLOWING THE ALARM WITHOUT REOCCURRENCE.

THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED LOW BLOOD PRESSURE AND THEIR CONDITION ¿WORSENED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE EVENT¿ (NOT FURTHER SPECIFIED). THE PATIENT RECEIVED UNSPECIFIED MEDICAL INTERVENTION.

THE EVENT HISTORY LOG INDICATED THAT THE USER WAS ABLE TO REPROGRAM AND RESTART THE INFUSION WITHIN 2 MINUTES FOLLOWING THE OCCURRENCE OF THE ALARM. AFTER THE INTERRUPTION OF THERAPY, THE USER RESTARTED THE INFUSION AT THE PREVIOUS RATE, WHICH INDICATES THAT THE THERAPY INTERRUPTION WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO IMPACT THE PATIENT'S CONDITION.

THEY TRIED TO TURN THE PUMP BACK ON AND IT WOULD NOT TURN ON. IT WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED IT FROM THE PRACTICE AREA. H11: THE DEVICE WAS RECEIVED FOR EVALUATION. FUNCTIONAL TESTING AND A REVIEW OF THE EVENT HISTORY LOG WERE PERFORMED AND DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY ISSUES RELATED TO THE CUSTOMER REPORTED CONDITION. DOWNSTREAM OCCLUSION(DSO) TESTING WAS PERFORMED AND THE DEVICE PASSED. A REVIEW OF THE HISTORY LOG REVEALED REVEALED MULTIPLE DOWNSTREAM OCCLUSION ALARMS DURING LAST DAY OF USE. THE LOG SHOWS THAT THE DOWNSTREAM OCCLUSION ENTERED SLEEP MODE AND AUTO-RESTARTED , THEREFORE THE DOWNSTREAM OCCLUSION WAS CLEARED. A SERVICE HISTORY REVEALED NO INDICATION THAT THE PARTS REPLACED DURING SERVICING CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. THE REPORTED CONDITION WAS NOT VERIFIED. THE ALLEGATION WAS SENT TO THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT(R&D) TEAM FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION ON A V8 DEVICE AND OBSERVED THE PUMP VIBRATION DURING DSO AND SUBSEQUENT SLEEP MODE IS OBSERVED WITH BOTH DSO AUTO RESTART ENABLED OR DISABLED SETTING FOR V8 DEVICE AND WITH DIFFERENT TUBE TYPES. THE PUMP VIBRATION IS STOPPED UNDER ANY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: WHEN ROLLER CLAMP IS REMOVED FROM DOWNSTREAM, DOOR CYCLING, AND STARTING THE INFUSION AFTER EXITING FROM SLEEP MODE. ADDITIONALLY, WHEN THE PUMP VIBRATION OCCURRED IN SLEEP MODE AFTER A DSO AT 999ML/HR. THE R&D TEAM DID NOT OBSERVED INFUSION OF FLUID EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A VIBRATION SOUND . THE CURRENT DESIGN OF THE SPECTRUM V8 PUMP IS A LARGE VOLUME PARENTERAL(LVP) INFUSION SYSTEM THAT CONSIST OF SHARP PROCESSOR AND MOTOR MICROPROCESSOR (PIC) CONTROLLER. SHARP PROCESSOR SENDS CURRENT PULSE DEMAND EQUIVALENT TO CURRENT RATE TO PIC CONTROLLER VIA SPI. PIC CONTROLLER MONITORS THE MOTOR CONTROL ALGORITHM. WHEN AN ALARM IS DETECTED THAT STOPS THE MOTOR, SHARP PROCESSOR TYPICALLY SETS THE CURRENT PULSE DEMAND AS ZERO TO STOP THE MOTOR. WHEN A DOWNSTREAM OCCLUSION IS DETECTED, SHARP PROCESSOR SENDS A COMMAND TO PIC CONTROLLER TO MOVE THE MOTOR TO HOLD MODE AND SETS THE CURRENT RATE TO ZERO. THE PIC CONTROLLER ANALYZES MOTOR MOVEMENT USING THE ENCODER FEEDBACK TO DETECT FORWARD AND REVERSE MOVEMENTS. A PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION PER DCR SPCT (B)(4) FOR V8 REGARDING THE REPORTED PROBLEM CONCLUDED \"A DOWNSTREAM OCCLUSION RESULTS IN PRESSURE BUILD-UP WITHIN THE IV SET BELOW THE PUMP. WHEN THE OCCLUSION IS DETECTED, THE PUMP WILL ALWAYS STOP WITH THE UPPER VALVE FULLY CLOSED. THE LOWER VALVE MAY BE IN ANY POSITION FROM FULLY CLOSED TO FULLY OPEN, DEPENDING ON ITS PRECISE POSITION IN THE PUMPING CYCLE AT THE MOMENT THE OCCLUSION IS DETECTED. IF ALL POWER WERE TO BE REMOVED FROM THE MOTOR UPON DETECTION OF A DOWNSTREAM OCCLUSION, THIS PRESSURE BUILT UP BELOW THE PUMP WOULD SEEK TO EQUALIZE BY FORCING THE LOWER VALVE AND PUMPING FINGERS OPEN TO THEIR MAXIMUM POSITION TO ALLOW FLUID TO PUSH BACK INTO THE PUMPING CHAMBER. NOT ONLY WOULD THIS ALLOW FOR BACKFLOW, BUT IT WOULD ALSO DROP THE PRESSURE BELOW THE PUMP SUCH THAT THE PUMP WOULD NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE OCCLUSION HAD BEEN RESOLVED AND COULD ALLOW RESTART WITHOUT REMOVAL OF THE OCCLUSION. BY DESIGN, THE SPECTRUM PUMP ACCOUNTS FOR THIS BY MAINTAINING THE PRECISE POSITION OF THE VALVES UPON DETECTION OF A DOWNSTREAM OCCLUSION. THE FAINT HUM FROM THE MOTOR IS THE SOUND OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IN ACTION; THE PUMP IS APPLYING JUST ENOUGH CURRENT TO THE MOTOR TO PREVENT ANY MOVEMENT OF THE VALVES. THIS FEATURE IS NOT NEEDED FOR OCCLUSIONS WHEN THE PUMP STOPS IN A POSITION WHERE THE LOWER VALVE AND PUMPING FINGERS ARE ALREADY OPEN TO THEIR MAXIMUM POSITION. MAINTENANCE OF THIS POSITION IS APPARENT WHEN OBSERVING A PRESSURE GAUGE CONNECTED BELOW THE PUMP DURING A DOWNSTREAM OCCLUSION; THE PRESSURE REMAINS STABLE. SINCE THE PUMP PROCESSOR REMAINS ACTIVE ANY TIME THE PUMP IS PLUGGED IN, THIS FEATURE REMAINS ACTIVE IF THE PUMP IS POWERED OFF (SLEEP MODE) WHILE PLUGGED IN. THIS ALLOWS THE SPECTRUM PUMP TO RELIABLY MONITOR THE STATUS OF A DOWNSTREAM OCCLUSION UNTIL IT HAS BEEN RESOLVED\" SHOULD ADDITIONAL RELEVANT INFORMATION BECOME AVAILABLE, A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED. 25212 W.
